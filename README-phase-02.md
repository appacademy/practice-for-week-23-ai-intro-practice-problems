# Intro To AI - Practice Problems - Phase 2

This phase will have you attempting to complete a React practice you have
previously encountered during your time at a/A. However this time **you are
challenged to write as much code as possible utilizing the outputs of a
generative AI tool**.

## Revisiting React with generative AI

Follow the link to the practice starter and set them up as instructed
(or to your preferences) starting with the React practice. When you are
required to write code, instead, write prompts to have your AI tool of choice
generate code on your behalf.

As you complete a step of the practice, move onto the next, writing prompts as
necessary to complete them.

This is a good time review what you found effective and what caused you issues.
Learning how to utilize these AI tools will not happen immediately but the only
way to get better with them is to dive in and iteratively experiment!

As you reflect on what you tried, consider how the prompts you used might help
you build a full stack project! Make some notes for future reference.

When you have completed this practice, prepare to discuss your experience at
the discussion period designated by your instructors.
